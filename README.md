# Minimax (alpha-beta pruning) Algorithm
Minimax is a backtracking algorithm used in decision-making and game theory to determine the best move for a player, provided that your opponent also plays optimally. It is commonly employed in two-player turn-based games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Backgammon, Mancala, and Chess.
